A small pizzeria operates with two employees: a chef and a cashier. The pizzeria operates for three hours each day. The chef can only work for two hours, and the cashier can work for three hours. The goal is to assign the chef and the cashier to work in a way that maximizes the total operating time of the pizzeria, ensuring both roles are filled during each operating hour.
Assumptions:

    The pizzeria needs both a chef and a cashier to operate in any given hour.
    The chef can only work for a maximum of 2 hours.
    The cashier can work all 3 hours if necessary.

We want to assign the chef and the cashier to maximize the total number of hours the pizzeria can operate.
