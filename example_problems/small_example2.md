A small tire factory operates for three shifts each day. The factory needs two types of workers: machinists and inspectors. Each shift requires at least one machinist and one inspector for the factory to operate.

    The factory can assign up to 2 machinists and 3 inspectors.
    The factory operates 3 shifts in total each day.
    Machinists can only work up to 2 shifts per day.
    Inspectors can work up to 3 shifts per day.

The objective is to maximize the number of shifts the factory operates, ensuring that each shift has both a machinist and an inspector available.
