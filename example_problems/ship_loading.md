# Container Ship Loading Dilemma

## The Vessel: SS Globetrotter
- Length: 366 meters
- Beam: 48 meters
- Draft: 15.2 meters
- Capacity: 14,000 TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units)
- Deck Configuration: 20 rows, 10 tiers above deck, 10 tiers below deck
- Reefer (refrigerated) container capacity: 800 units

## Cargo Types and Quantities
1. General merchandise: 5000 TEU
2. Electronics: 2000 TEU
3. Hazardous materials: 1000 TEU
4. Refrigerated goods: 700 TEU
5. Oversized cargo: 300 TEU
6. Empty containers for repositioning: 1500 TEU

## Loading Constraints
- Hazardous materials must be kept at least 2 containers apart horizontally and cannot be stacked
- Refrigerated containers must be placed near power outlets (limited to specific areas)
- Heavier containers must be loaded below lighter ones
- Containers for earlier ports of call must be more accessible
- Oversized cargo requires special handling and positioning
- The ship's stability and trim must be maintained (weight distribution)

## Ports of Call (in order)
1. Shanghai, China
2. Singapore
3. Mumbai, India
4. Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
5. Rotterdam, Netherlands
6. New York, USA

## Time Constraints
- Loading must be completed within 48 hours
- Crane operating speed: average 30 containers per hour
- 4 cranes available, but only 3 can operate simultaneously due to space constraints

## Additional Factors
- 20% of containers are 40-foot units (counting as 2 TEU each)
- 5% chance of last-minute cargo plan changes for each cargo type
- Weather forecast predicts intermittent rain, potentially slowing loading operations
- Labor union rules require breaks every 4 hours, lasting 30 minutes
- Port congestion may delay the start of loading by up to 4 hours

## Special Requirements
- VIP client's cargo (200 TEU of electronics) must be loaded last for security reasons
- Environmental regulations require certain hazardous materials to be accessible for inspection
- Ship's fuel efficiency is affected by weight distribution
- Some containers may arrive late to the port (80% chance all cargo arrives on time)

## Unexpected Events (to be factored into planning)
- 10% chance of a crane breakdown lasting 2-4 hours
- 15% chance of customs holding 100-300 random containers for extra inspection
- 5% chance of a labor dispute causing a 2-hour work stoppage

## Objective
Create an optimal loading plan for the SS Globetrotter that:
1. Maximizes the use of available space
2. Ensures all safety and regulatory requirements are met
3. Optimizes for efficient unloading at each port of call
4. Minimizes the total loading time
5. Maintains ship stability and fuel efficiency
6. Adapts to potential unexpected events and last-minute changes

## Additional Considerations
- Some ports have height restrictions for the first row of on-deck containers
- Certain cargoes must not be exposed to direct sunlight
- The ship's water ballast system can be used to adjust trim and stability during loading
- Proper weight distribution can reduce fuel consumption by up to 5%
- There's a bonus for completing loading ahead of schedule, and a penalty for delays
